The GM decides the guard can be bribed and secretly rolls 21 on the 4d10, meaning the price for bribing the guard is 21 Brass. Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

Of course, you can also use the Skill to escape a conﬂict unseen…</p>\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Specializations: </span>Rural, Underground, Urban&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Options: Shadowing</h3>\n<p>Shadowing is following someone secretly. To do this requires a Combined Perception and Stealth Test. If the target is actively trying to lose a tail, it is Opposed with the target’s Stealth Skill.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you pass the Perception Test, and fail the Stealth Test you follow your target, but are spotted. If you fail the perception Test, yet pass the Stealth Test, you lose your target, but go unnoticed</p>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"advanced":{"value":"bsc","type":"String"},"grouped":{"value":"isSpec","type":"String"},"characteristic":{"type":"String","label":"Characteristic","value":"ag"},"advances":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":0,"costModifier":0},"modifier":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":0},"total":{"type":"Number","label":"Total"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"flags":{},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/skills/basic-skill-ag.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"Ggx0bRaCuq8MbF0g","name":"Gold Crown","type":"money","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"quantity":{"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","value":0},"encumbrance":{"type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","value":0.005},"location":{"type":"Number","label":"Location","value":0},"coinValue":{"label":"Value (in d)","type":"Number","value":240},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"flags":{"_sheetTab":"description"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/currency/goldcrown.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"KB8HgDz56dh2w7w1","name":"Silver Shilling","type":"money","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"quantity":{"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","value":0},"encumbrance":{"type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","value":0.005},"location":{"type":"Number","label":"Location","value":0},"coinValue":{"label":"Value (in d)","type":"Number","value":12},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"flags":{"_sheetTab":"description"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/currency/silvershilling.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"0MYOJFx3vkYA95B4","name":"Brass Penny","type":"money","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"quantity":{"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","value":0},"encumbrance":{"type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","value":0.005},"location":{"type":"Number","label":"Location","value":0},"coinValue":{"label":"Value (in d)","type":"Number","value":1},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"flags":{"_sheetTab":"description"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/currency/brasspenny.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"BKH7gCUnuwmXobmi","name":"Night Vision","type":"trait","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"<p>You can see very well in natural darkness.

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n<p>If larger:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n<li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n<li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If smaller:</p>\n<p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n<p>You suffer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">\n<table style=\"direction: ltr; border-collapse: collapse; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\" title=\"\" border=\"1\" summary=\"\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Size </span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Wounds</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Tiny</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">1</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Little</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Toughness Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Small</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Average</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Large</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 4.0in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×2</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Enormous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×4</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Monstrous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×8</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"rollable":{"value":false,"damage":false,"skill":"","label":"Rollable","type":"Boolean","rollCharacteristic":"","bonusCharacteristic":"","dice":"","defaultDifficulty":"challenging","SL":true,"attackType":"melee"},"specification":{"value":"Little","type":"String","label":"Specification"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"sort":200000,"flags":{"_sheetTab":"description","core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.wfrp4e-core.traits.8slW8CJ2oVTxeQ6q"}},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/traits/trait.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"3HZYLLZrRAeChfYF","name":"Stride","type":"trait","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"<p>The creature has a long stride, perhaps because it is a quadruped or has especially long legs.

Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal.

Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

Of course, you can also use the Skill to escape a conﬂict unseen…</p>\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Specializations: </span>Rural, Underground, Urban&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Options: Shadowing</h3>\n<p>Shadowing is following someone secretly.

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n<p>If larger:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n<li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n<li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If smaller:</p>\n<p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n<p>You suffer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way.

His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

Of course, you can also use the Skill to escape a conﬂict unseen…</p>\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Specializations: </span>Rural, Underground, Urban&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Options: Shadowing</h3>\n<p>Shadowing is following someone secretly.

It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way.

Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

Of course, you can also use the Skill to escape a conﬂict unseen…</p>\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Specializations: </span>Rural, Underground, Urban&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Options: Shadowing</h3>\n<p>Shadowing is following someone secretly.

It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way.

Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way.

Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal.

Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal.

Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

Of course, you can also use the Skill to escape a conﬂict unseen…</p>\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Specializations: </span>Rural, Underground, Urban&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Options: Shadowing</h3>\n<p>Shadowing is following someone secretly. To do this requires a Combined Perception and Stealth Test. If the target is actively trying to lose a tail, it is Opposed with the target’s Stealth Skill.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you pass the Perception Test, and fail the Stealth Test you follow your target, but are spotted. If you fail the perception Test, yet pass the Stealth Test, you lose your target, but go unnoticed</p>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"advanced":{"value":"bsc","type":"String"},"grouped":{"value":"isSpec","type":"String"},"characteristic":{"type":"String","label":"Characteristic","value":"ag"},"advances":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":0,"costModifier":0},"modifier":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":0},"total":{"type":"Number","label":"Total"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"flags":{},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/skills/basic-skill-ag.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"Ggx0bRaCuq8MbF0g","name":"Gold Crown","type":"money","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"quantity":{"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","value":0},"encumbrance":{"type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","value":0.005},"location":{"type":"Number","label":"Location","value":0},"coinValue":{"label":"Value (in d)","type":"Number","value":240},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"flags":{"_sheetTab":"description"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/currency/goldcrown.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"KB8HgDz56dh2w7w1","name":"Silver Shilling","type":"money","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"quantity":{"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","value":0},"encumbrance":{"type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","value":0.005},"location":{"type":"Number","label":"Location","value":0},"coinValue":{"label":"Value (in d)","type":"Number","value":12},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"flags":{"_sheetTab":"description"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/currency/silvershilling.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"0MYOJFx3vkYA95B4","name":"Brass Penny","type":"money","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"quantity":{"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","value":0},"encumbrance":{"type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","value":0.005},"location":{"type":"Number","label":"Location","value":0},"coinValue":{"label":"Value (in d)","type":"Number","value":1},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"flags":{"_sheetTab":"description"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/currency/brasspenny.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"Xz4iF7IbWGC9tS7W","name":"Size","type":"trait","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">This trait represents creatures whose size differ from the game standard (i.e. roughly human sized).

It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">\n<table style=\"direction: ltr; border-collapse: collapse; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\" title=\"\" border=\"1\" summary=\"\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Size </span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Wounds</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Tiny</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">1</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Little</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Toughness Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Small</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Average</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Large</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 4.0in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×2</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Enormous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×4</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Monstrous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×8</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"rollable":{"value":false,"damage":false,"skill":"","label":"Rollable","type":"Boolean","rollCharacteristic":"","bonusCharacteristic":"","dice":"","defaultDifficulty":"challenging","SL":true,"attackType":"melee"},"specification":{"value":"Little","type":"String","label":"Specification"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"sort":1200000,"flags":{"_sheetTab":"description"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/traits/trait.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"69jl2bIJ1eWODK9s","name":"Cold Blooded","type":"trait","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"The creature is cold-blooded and slow to react.

Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

Of course, you can also use the Skill to escape a conﬂict unseen…</p>\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Specializations: </span>Rural, Underground, Urban&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Options: Shadowing</h3>\n<p>Shadowing is following someone secretly. To do this requires a Combined Perception and Stealth Test. If the target is actively trying to lose a tail, it is Opposed with the target’s Stealth Skill.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you pass the Perception Test, and fail the Stealth Test you follow your target, but are spotted. If you fail the perception Test, yet pass the Stealth Test, you lose your target, but go unnoticed</p>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"advanced":{"value":"bsc","type":"String"},"grouped":{"value":"isSpec","type":"String"},"characteristic":{"type":"String","label":"Characteristic","value":"ag"},"advances":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":0,"costModifier":0},"modifier":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":0},"total":{"type":"Number","label":"Total"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"flags":{},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/skills/basic-skill-ag.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"Ggx0bRaCuq8MbF0g","name":"Gold Crown","type":"money","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"quantity":{"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","value":0},"encumbrance":{"type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","value":0.005},"location":{"type":"Number","label":"Location","value":0},"coinValue":{"label":"Value (in d)","type":"Number","value":240},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"flags":{"_sheetTab":"description"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/currency/goldcrown.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"KB8HgDz56dh2w7w1","name":"Silver Shilling","type":"money","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"quantity":{"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","value":0},"encumbrance":{"type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","value":0.005},"location":{"type":"Number","label":"Location","value":0},"coinValue":{"label":"Value (in d)","type":"Number","value":12},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"flags":{"_sheetTab":"description"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/currency/silvershilling.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"0MYOJFx3vkYA95B4","name":"Brass Penny","type":"money","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"quantity":{"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","value":0},"encumbrance":{"type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","value":0.005},"location":{"type":"Number","label":"Location","value":0},"coinValue":{"label":"Value (in d)","type":"Number","value":1},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"flags":{"_sheetTab":"description"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/currency/brasspenny.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"1t8xK9nBswWmgPhG","name":"Arboreal","type":"trait","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"The creature is at home in the forests.

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n<p>If larger:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n<li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n<li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If smaller:</p>\n<p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n<p>You suffer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">\n<table style=\"direction: ltr; border-collapse: collapse; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\" title=\"\" border=\"1\" summary=\"\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Size </span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Wounds</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Tiny</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">1</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Little</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Toughness Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Small</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Average</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Large</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 4.0in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×2</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Enormous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×4</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Monstrous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×8</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"rollable":{"value":false,"damage":false,"skill":"","label":"Rollable","type":"Boolean","rollCharacteristic":"","bonusCharacteristic":"","dice":"","defaultDifficulty":"challenging","SL":true,"attackType":"melee"},"specification":{"value":"Little","type":"String","label":"Specification"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"sort":3300000,"flags":{"_sheetTab":"description","core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.wfrp4e-core.traits.8slW8CJ2oVTxeQ6q"}},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/traits/trait.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"u7cTtq1pdoGYFxAv","name":"Skittish","type":"trait","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"The creature is easily scared by magic or loud noises.

Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

Of course, you can also use the Skill to escape a conﬂict unseen…</p>\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Specializations: </span>Rural, Underground, Urban&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Options: Shadowing</h3>\n<p>Shadowing is following someone secretly.

His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way.

Each will react to Intimidate based on their individual personalities and how successful you were in menacing them, but in all cases, they will back down or move out of the way and will not speak out against you, or they will alternatively accept combat is the only way forward and prepare their weapons.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In combat, you cause @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.psychologies.Ib2YQYChktDFN93y]{Fear} in all Intimidated targets. You may also use your Intimidate Skill instead of Melee when defending against those afraid of you, causing the Intimidated parties to back away from the fight with your will and posture alone. Further, with your GM’s approval, you may use Intimidate to ‘attack’ such targets, issuing specific commands, such as ‘drop your weapons’ or ‘get out of here!’. However, if you fail any of these subsequent Intimidate Tests, you no longer Intimidate (or cause Fear) in affected opponents. With your GM’s permission you may try to Intimidate them again in a later Round, but this will incur a negative modifier, as they are less likely to fear you having seen through your bravado once already.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Alternative Characteristics For Intimidate</h3>\n<p>While strength is the default stat for Intimidate tests, the GM may decree certain situations may allow you to use a different characteristic: a steely witch hunter may use Willpower to stare down an inquisitive bystander, or an academic may use Intelligence to cow a lowly student with his intimidating knowledge, for instance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Example: </span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Facing a group of footpads, Svetlana the Strong rolls 4 SL on her Intimidate Test.

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n<p>If larger:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n<li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n<li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If smaller:</p>\n<p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n<p>You suffer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">\n<table style=\"direction: ltr;

You then guess that target amount and the GM will tell you if the price is higher, lower, or equal. Each SL from your initial Bribery Test gives you another guess.

Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n<p>If larger:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n<li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n<li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If smaller:</p>\n<p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n<p>You suffer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">\n<table style=\"direction: ltr; border-collapse: collapse; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\" title=\"\" border=\"1\" summary=\"\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Size </span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Wounds</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Tiny</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">1</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Little</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Toughness Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Small</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Average</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Large</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 4.0in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×2</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Enormous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×4</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Monstrous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×8</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"rollable":{"value":false,"damage":false,"skill":"","label":"Rollable","type":"Boolean","rollCharacteristic":"","bonusCharacteristic":"","dice":"","defaultDifficulty":"challenging","SL":true,"attackType":"melee"},"specification":{"value":"Little","type":"String","label":"Specification"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"sort":300000,"flags":{"_sheetTab":"details"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/traits/trait.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"lu9EaeKzJts9R46F","name":"Night Vision","type":"trait","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"<p>You can see very well in natural darkness.

Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

Of course, you can also use the Skill to escape a conﬂict unseen…</p>\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Specializations: </span>Rural, Underground, Urban&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Options: Shadowing</h3>\n<p>Shadowing is following someone secretly. To do this requires a Combined Perception and Stealth Test. If the target is actively trying to lose a tail, it is Opposed with the target’s Stealth Skill.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you pass the Perception Test, and fail the Stealth Test you follow your target, but are spotted. If you fail the perception Test, yet pass the Stealth Test, you lose your target, but go unnoticed</p>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"advanced":{"value":"bsc","type":"String"},"grouped":{"value":"isSpec","type":"String"},"characteristic":{"type":"String","label":"Characteristic","value":"ag"},"advances":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":0,"costModifier":0},"modifier":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":0},"total":{"type":"Number","label":"Total"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"flags":{},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/skills/basic-skill-ag.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"Ggx0bRaCuq8MbF0g","name":"Gold Crown","type":"money","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"quantity":{"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","value":0},"encumbrance":{"type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","value":0.005},"location":{"type":"Number","label":"Location","value":0},"coinValue":{"label":"Value (in d)","type":"Number","value":240},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"flags":{"_sheetTab":"description"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/currency/goldcrown.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"KB8HgDz56dh2w7w1","name":"Silver Shilling","type":"money","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"quantity":{"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","value":0},"encumbrance":{"type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","value":0.005},"location":{"type":"Number","label":"Location","value":0},"coinValue":{"label":"Value (in d)","type":"Number","value":12},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"flags":{"_sheetTab":"description"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/currency/silvershilling.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"0MYOJFx3vkYA95B4","name":"Brass Penny","type":"money","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"quantity":{"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","value":0},"encumbrance":{"type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","value":0.005},"location":{"type":"Number","label":"Location","value":0},"coinValue":{"label":"Value (in d)","type":"Number","value":1},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"flags":{"_sheetTab":"description"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/currency/brasspenny.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"Dca9e1rrAXmxtbDU","name":"Size","type":"trait","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">This trait represents creatures whose size differ from the game standard (i.e. roughly human sized).

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n<p>If larger:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n<li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n<li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If smaller:</p>\n<p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n<p>You suffer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">\n<table style=\"direction: ltr; border-collapse: collapse; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\" title=\"\" border=\"1\" summary=\"\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Size </span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Wounds</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Tiny</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">1</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Little</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Toughness Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Small</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Average</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Large</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 4.0in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×2</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Enormous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×4</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Monstrous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×8</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"rollable":{"value":false,"damage":false,"skill":"","label":"Rollable","type":"Boolean","rollCharacteristic":"","bonusCharacteristic":"","dice":"","defaultDifficulty":"challenging","SL":true,"attackType":"melee"},"specification":{"value":"Tiny","type":"String","label":"Specification"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"sort":3200000,"flags":{"_sheetTab":"details"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/traits/trait.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"RNDDbQbE9evnL7zX","name":"Amphibious","type":"trait","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"The creature is at home in water.

You then guess that target amount and the GM will tell you if the price is higher, lower, or equal. Each SL from your initial Bribery Test gives you another guess.

Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n<p>If larger:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n<li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n<li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If smaller:</p>\n<p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n<p>You suffer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">\n<table style=\"direction: ltr; border-collapse: collapse; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\" title=\"\" border=\"1\" summary=\"\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Size </span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Wounds</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Tiny</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">1</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Little</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Toughness Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Small</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Average</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Large</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 4.0in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×2</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Enormous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×4</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Monstrous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×8</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"rollable":{"value":false,"damage":false,"skill":"","label":"Rollable","type":"Boolean","rollCharacteristic":"","bonusCharacteristic":"","dice":"","defaultDifficulty":"challenging","SL":true,"attackType":"melee"},"specification":{"value":"Small","type":"String","label":"Specification"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"sort":200000,"flags":{"_sheetTab":"description","core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.wfrp4e-core.traits.8slW8CJ2oVTxeQ6q"}},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/traits/trait.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"3HZYLLZrRAeChfYF","name":"Stride","type":"trait","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"<p>The creature has a long stride, perhaps because it is a quadruped or has especially long legs.

If your target is not susceptible, you cannot afford the fee, or your foes do not speak your tongue, your pathetic attempts to buy them off will be doomed to fail. Of course, if they have the advantage of numbers, what’s to prevent them from taking all of your money?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Snorri is trying to bribe his way past a city watchman; a character of the Brass Tier 2, meaning they roll 4d10 Brass for Income. The GM decides the guard can be bribed and secretly rolls 21 on the 4d10, meaning the price for bribing the guard is 21 Brass. Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30. Smiling, the watchman waves Snorri through.</em></p>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"advanced":{"value":"bsc","type":"String"},"grouped":{"value":"noSpec","type":"String"},"characteristic":{"type":"String","label":"Characteristic","value":"fel"},"advances":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":0,"costModifier":0},"modifier":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":0},"total":{"type":"Number","label":"Total"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"flags":{"_sheetTab":"details"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/skills/basic-skill-fel.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"exLrBrn2mjb6x2Cq","name":"Charm","type":"skill","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"<p>Charm makes people think favorably of you, your opinions, and proposed actions.

It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">\n<table style=\"direction: ltr; border-collapse: collapse; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\" title=\"\" border=\"1\" summary=\"\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Size </span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Wounds</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Tiny</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">1</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Little</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Toughness Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Small</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Average</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Large</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 4.0in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×2</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Enormous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×4</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Monstrous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×8</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"rollable":{"value":false,"damage":false,"skill":"","label":"Rollable","type":"Boolean","rollCharacteristic":"","bonusCharacteristic":"","dice":"","defaultDifficulty":"challenging","SL":true,"attackType":"melee"},"specification":{"value":"Tiny","type":"String","label":"Specification"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"sort":300000,"flags":{"_sheetTab":"details"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/traits/trait.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"nQyHi7yOno35d2tz","name":"Bat (Familiar)","type":"career","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"<p>Each bound familiar has a selection of bonus skills and talents it may always consider apart of its current career.
