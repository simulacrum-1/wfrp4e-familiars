As with Wizards who bind or create Familiars, Daemonologists can benefit from the service of a Daemonic helper, an assistant that lends its power and expertise to the spellcaster. Like other Familiars, Daemons can improve a Wizard’s power, giving him a boost to his magical strength or even storing magical energy. Though the rewards are great, they are not without risk.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3>Manifest the Least of Daemons</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">@Compendium[wfrp4e-familiars.familiar_items.RbhsabpkYjchFxna]{Manifest the Least of Daemons (Daemonology)}</span><br /><span style=\"font-style:normal\">@Compendium[wfrp4e-familiars.familiar_items.2bX7eAzBvcKK97Wp]{Manifest the Least of Daemons (Undivided)}</span></p>\n<p>CN: 4<br />Range: Willpower Bonus yards<br />Target: Special<br />Duration: Willpower Bonus rounds<br />Lore: Dark Magic and Chaos Magic</p>\n<p>You channel a sickening flow of Dhar, briefly forcing a rent into the fabric of reality.

The process is straigt-forward.</p>\n<p>First, you must win an <strong>Opposed Channeling (Dhar) vs. Willpower</strong> Test to command the daemon and initiate the bargaining contest.</p>\n<p>The command you give the daemon is always some form of <em>“I command you to bargain with me to become my familiar.”</em> Then the timer starts: you now have your Willpower Bonus rounds to seal the bargain with the daemon.</p>\n<p>To seal the bargain, you need to succeed at a <strong>Dramatic Opposed Haggling</strong> Test. The daemon may choose to haggle with its Fellowship, Willpower, or Intelligence, whatever it prefers.</p>\n<p>Your Haggling skill is<strong> limited by your understanding of</strong> @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.XQiiwS9m2Du1IMUz]{Language (Daemonic)}. Treat this as a Combined Skill Test, as you must negotiate in the daemon’s language (unless, for some unlikely reason, the daemon decides to negotiate in your native tongue).</p>\n<p>You may make the Haggling test each round, whether you succeeded or failed in the previous round, trying to secure a better bargain, as long you progressively score more Success Levels each round than you scored on the previous round. The bargaining ends when you decide it does, when you fail to score more Success Levels than the round before, or automatically when the timer runs out.</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> You summon a daemon and have 4 rounds to bargain because your WPB is 4. On the first round, you fail the Haggling contest for -2 SL. On the second round, you succeed with 1 SL. You continue to bargain, hoping to get more 2 or more SLs. However, you succeed, but only with 1 SL. Because this is not more SLs than the previous round, the bargaining stops (but is successful with 1 SL).</p>\n<p>You need at least 1 SL to succeed at the bargain.</p>\n<p>0 SL Marginal Success is not enough.</p>\n<p>When the timer ends (after your Willpower Bonus rounds) or you voluntarily end the bargaining, if you have not achieved at least 1 SL during the haggling, no bargain is reached and the daemon returns to the chaos from whence it came.</p>\n<p>If you fumble a bargaining roll, the demon laughs at your petty attempts to control it, inflicting you with a @Table[minormis]{Minor Miscast Table} result out of spite. This does not necessarily end the bargaining, but it might make it harder to continue and might even threaten the sanctity of any octogram you’ve drawn. Unfortunately for you, the daemon does not suffer any such particular penalty for fumbling its rolls.</p>\n<h3>Gifts</h3>\n<p>You may offer gifts to the daemon to entice it to accept your bargain. The better the gift, the better the bonus in Success Levels you get on <em>one</em> opposed bargaining round. You can offer more and better gifts each round, attempting to increase your Success Levels.</p>\n<p>You may offer the following gifts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Your Immortal Soul.</strong> If you offer the daemon your soul so that the daemon can claim your soul at the end of its service, you gain +2 SLs for one bargaining round. You also gain 1 point of Corruption automatically when you make this offer.</li>\n<li><strong>Limited Service.</strong> If you limit daemon’s term of service to your Willpower Bonus in years, you gain +1 SLs for one bargaining round. If you limit the service to your Willpower Bonus in months, +2 SLs. If you limit the service to your Willpower Bonus is days, +3 SLs.</li>\n<li><strong>Blood Sacrifice.</strong> For each sentient mortal being (with a soul) that you sacrifice to the daemon in the daemon’s presence, you gain +2 SLs for one bargaining round. If you sacrifice a beast (notably, something the Bestial trait), you gain +1 SL for one bargaining round. Daemons become surprisingly patient if sacrifices are forthcoming and will give a daemonologist up to an hour to line up and perform the sacrifices in front of it, effectively pausing the timer for that round. <em>Daemons love a good show</em>. You may make up to your WPB individual sacrifices (sentient, animal, or both) per bargaining round. You also gain 1 Corruption automatically when you make this offer. Daemons of Khorne are particularly impressed by blood sacrifices and you gain a bonus +1 SL for any number of blood sacrifices you perform in their honor.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bargain Success Table</h3>\n<table style=\"width:99.0712%\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:9.89106%\"><strong>SL</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:89.3277%\"><strong> Quality of Bargain</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:9.89106%\"><strong>7+</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:89.3277%\">Somehow the daemonlogist has convinced the daemon to treat them almost - but not quite - like an equal partner in the arrangement.

The GM should decide beforehand what the daemon wants (the eyes of children, a steady supply of blood, worship, Human sacrifice and so on) and then bargains for service based on how closely the caster comes to the daemon’s desires. So long as the terms favor the daemon, the GM may do away with the opposed tests and simply grant the familiar to the daemonologist.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4> </h4>\n<h4>Success in Bargaining with a Daemon</h4>\n<p>No bargain with a daemon is <em>perfect</em>. The daemon will always bargain in bad faith and always attempt to subvert the bargain somehow. No matter how hard the mortal tries, they never can <em>completely</em> outwit the eldritch intelligence of daemons. At the very best, the mortal can make a bargain that minimally weighs in the daemon’s favor. At worst, the mortal may find himself more the slave than the master.</p>\n<p>The degree by which the daemon has subverted the bargain is based on the best success level the daemonologist achieved during the bargaining rounds (see the table on the previous page).</p>\n<h3>Side-Effects of the Bargain</h3>\n<p><strong>Corruption: </strong>Whether or not the bargain is struck, the daemonlogist immediately gains 1 Corruption point. Additionally, the daemonic familiar’s constant presence will continue to corrupt the daemonologist over time. The daemonologist will automatically gain 1 point of Corruption every Toughness Bonus months they have the familiar. Additionally, any time the familiar uses a special ability (such as a Malice’s ability to imbue Frenzy) on the daemonologist (or an ally), the target must resist this @Corruption[minor]{Minor Corruption} as per the normal rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Stability: </strong>One of the things the daemonic familiar gets out of the bargain with a mortal is <em>stability</em>. While within its Willpower yards of its master, the familiar loses its @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.D0ImWEIMSDgElsnl]{Unstable} trait. Outside that range, it regains its @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.D0ImWEIMSDgElsnl]{Unstable} trait.</p>\n<p><strong>Daemonic Familiar Special Ability: </strong>As part of the bargain, the daemonic familiar gains a special daemonic familiar ability. Whether this is a natural ability, a bizarre side-effect of the bargain, or a sign of chaotic grace from the Ruinous Powers for furthering their ends, no one knows, but these special abilities are one principle reasons daemonologists bargain for familiars. Refer to the @Table[familiars-daemonic-abilities]{Daemonic Abilities Table} to determine what special ability the daemonic familiar has when you complete the bargain.</p>\n<p><strong>Jealousy: </strong>Unlike non-daemonic familiars, daemonic familiars jealousy guard their positions and seek to possess their master’s entire attention. While there is no invisible hand preventing a daemonologist from creating or binding another non-daemonic familiar, the daemonic familiar will stop at nothing to hinder, harm, and destroy the rival familiar, given the chance. A daemonologist can summon multiple daemonic familiars, as long as each successive familiar(s) are more powerful than the preceding one(s).</p>\n<h3>Demonic Familiar Motives</h3>\n<p>Daemons exist to corrupt and destroy, and so even if bound by strict terms of service, the daemon always works against his master. He will not overtly betray him, but he will work to put his master into dangerous positions, putting his master’s life at risk or simply making life more difficult. Canny wizards include provisions in their negotiations to lessen the risk of a prolonged relationship with the daemon.</p>\n<p>The daemonic familiar should always be run as an NPC. GMs should feel free to use these creatures as plot devices, foils, or even as antagonists for the character that summoned it. This said, the familiar should not be such a risk that the character regrets binding the daemon: even if the bargain is bad one, the character still feels the enticing pleasure of power and the daemon will always string the character along without pushing them to far into regret. Instead, the character should always wonder what their daemon intends, why it does what it does, and be on the look out for the daemon’s betrayals (minor as they may be).</p>\n<h3>Improving Daemonic Familiars</h3>\n<p>Once the caster binds the familiar, the daemon automatically enters the one of the following familiar careers, though it still must buy talents and advances with future earned experience points.</p>\n<p>Daemonic familiars gain experience points at half the rate of their masters: i.e., for every 2 points a familiar’s master accumulates, the familiar earns 1. Familiars never earn experience points on their own.</p>\n<h4>Daemonic Familiar Basic Careers</h4>\n<p>Daemonic familiars may follow careers just like any other character, though they are restricted by their nature. They are intelligent and freewilled beings, with desires and interests of their own.</p>\n<p>When the bargain is reached, the daemonologist (or GM) selects a career for the familiar from the following list:</p>\n<p><strong>Initial Daemonic Familiar Careers:</strong> @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.rjUjdQrWHWazjkRC]{Artist} (Slaanesh daemons only), @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.cIBJfaY9DKJh5ZEM]{Scholar}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.m6WuSnrrW7QllX63]{Chaos Wizard} (Nurgle or Tzeentch daemons only), @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.djOQaw7iRfec9UEj]{Beggar}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.g12yhcU74qsRKxXX]{Servant}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.2RxWvPZCKW2ShY5a]{Hunter}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.8pk2uCvAMUAXWbcP]{Messenger}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.LaTDWvLySPKGojiW]{Huffer}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.TgcyR0ZdG6bMOK9o]{Thief}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.qaL8gLZdfOL5F5UV]{Guard}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.kT0ZI0LoHmIvhjPk]{Soldier} (Khorne daemons only) A Chaos Wizard familiar adheres to the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.m6WuSnrrW7QllX63]{Wizard} career, but pursues the lores of Chaos.</p>\n<p>A daemonic familiar’s career isn’t <em>exactly</em> like a following normal career, but represents a roughed-in estimate of familiar’s proclivities.</p>\n<p>Daemonic familiar careers don’t have Social Status or Trappings. However, any daemonic familiar can <em>conjure as a free action</em> any career trapping that it wants to have for its own use.</p>\n<h4>Substitute Skills</h4>\n<p>Not all skills listed in a career may make sense for daemonic familiars. If a skill seems ridiculous or inappropriate for the familiar, substitute a skill from the following list to customize the familiar’s career more to your liking and the demands of logic:</p>\n<p><strong>Substitute Daemonic Skills:</strong> @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.LGHozP5gmQ8cuDQV]{Athletics}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.exLrBrn2mjb6x2Cq]{Charm}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.pxNjTxsp1Kp0SmQe]{Cool}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.CcNJsS4jSwB6Ug1J]{Endurance}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.cYtU0ORRFCOpQLWz]{Intuition}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.XQiiwS9m2Du1IMUz]{Language (Any)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.DRO5DLF6UcfkvNSh]{Lore (Any)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.F8NfBZdVSEIGCMtu]{Melee (Any)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.Fs06sr7y9JKpVQmB]{Perception}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.MeXCAQ3wqJzX07X7]{Ride (Appropriate Anima)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.McTtmZu3Ac8Lh48W]{Stealth (Any)}</p>\n<h4>Inappropriate Talents</h4>\n<p>Not all talents may make sense for daemonic familiars. In these cases, there are no substitutions - the talent is just not available.</p>\n<h4>Advanced Familiar Careers</h4>\n<p>Daemonic familiars must complete their initial career before advancing, but otherwise advance like player characters. In addition to the careers listed above, familiars may enter the following careers after completing their initial career:</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Familiar Careers:</strong> @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.m6WuSnrrW7QllX63]{Wizard} (Chaos or otherwise), @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.DAHJ4cu3WiGCdakE]{Investigator}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.Tt8DCpewqkmBq02v]{Watchman}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.J8ejrXE0zWMjNsZd]{Advisor}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.dWLxT0zRnDFbwTKZ]{Spy}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.pxxGfn6ze45dwg4Y]{Hedge Witch}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.Xl9yyv67BB8a8XFo]{Scout}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.b96g5MZr3rk5zYAo]{Entertainer}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.TaOvUqKMJoPeuynD]{Smuggler}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.5ITpDJoRHlIgbE0g]{Witch}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.15N8GauWXWfbYbEQ]{Pit Fighter}</p>\n<h4>Magical Careers</h4>\n<p>A daemonic familiar may enter any magical career in the list above that it wants to. It is not beholden to its master for magical knowledge. Most daemonic familiars so inclined to magic may choose to follow the path of Chaos Wizard. It is not unheard of - in fact it is quite normal - for daemonic familiars to patronizingly teach their chaos magic to their “masters”.</p>\n<p>Daemonic familiars of Khorne never follow magical careers. In truth, they can (at best) barely contain their contempt for their daemonlogist “master”.</p>\n<h3>Daemonic Familiar Special Abilities</h3>\n<p>In addition to the powers already available to the daemons, the daemonic familiar also gains other abilities that enhance its usefulness to the caster. As the daemonic familiar gains experience points, it may spend them to gain additional abilities. Each Familiar starts with one special ability, generated on @Table[familiars-daemonic-abilities]{Daemonic Abilities Table}. Both daemonic familiars and their masters may also contribute XP toward buying new familiar abilities in the course of play.</p>\n<p>Daemonic familiar special abilities are learned using a modified @JournalEntry[Unusual Learning] Endeavor. The master and familiar do not need to seek out a specific trainer. Each new familiar ability costs 100 XP plus 100 XP for every special ability the familiar already has, which may be paid by the master, the familiar, or both in combination. The master or the familiar must succeed a <strong>Hard (–20) Willpower</strong> Test. The endeavor costs [[/roll 2d10]] shillings per 100 XP spent to obtain the new ability.</p>\n<h4>@Compendium[wfrp4e-familiars.familiar_items.8YmcDmC9FmcukUGj]{Chaos Reservoir}</h4>\n<p>As @Compendium[wfrp4e-familiars.familiar_items.8zjXPqCs8ZkEswto]{Aethyric Reservoir}, but the released spell also counts as a @Corruption[minor]{Minor Corruption} that must be resisted by the target.</p>\n<h4>@Compendium[wfrp4e-familiars.familiar_items.miDIt7narA0vrZcC]{Bond of Blood}</h4>\n<p>As @Compendium[wfrp4e-familiars.familiar_items.wq4IVVR3Gebj8vhM]{Link of Psyche}, except the bonus is +20 rather than +10 and the Bonds of Blood increases the number of Corruption points the daemonologist automatically gains every Toughness Bonus months to 2 (see Side-Effects of the Bargain).</p>\n<h4>@Compendium[wfrp4e-familiars.familiar_items.BcR8jqbR1BDsOPvx]{Luck of the Damned}</h4>\n<p>As @Compendium[wfrp4e-familiars.familiar_items.a9c3hZXI6D16Gur4]{Lucky Charm}, except the daemon has 2 points and the Fortune Point also counts as a @Corruption[minor]{Minor Corruption} that must be resisted by the target.</p>\n<h4>@Compendium[wfrp4e-familiars.familiar_items.iS18K7lIEp6d9g2C]{Resolve of the Wicked}</h4>\n<p>As @Compendium[wfrp4e-familiars.familiar_items.roOLZtvJXAehjtAF]{Depth of Resolve}, except the daemon has 2 points and the Resolve Point also counts as a @Corruption[minor]{Minor Corruption} that must be resisted by the target.</p>\n<h4>@Compendium[wfrp4e-familiars.familiar_items.OHcsSjf3HVNCzvir]{Daemonic Magic Focus}</h4>\n<p>As @Compendium[wfrp4e-familiars.familiar_items.NClFduYQ6vnOFygk]{Magic Focus}, except the daemonologist can modify the quantitative effects of his spells twice (doubling two or tripling one effect).</p>\n<h4>@Compendium[wfrp4e-familiars.familiar_items.LRk08nisxmlkBcmU]{Blood Focus} (Daemons of Khorne Alternative)</h4>\n<p>Instead of @Compendium[wfrp4e-familiars.familiar_items.NClFduYQ6vnOFygk]{Magic Focus}, the daemonologist gains Blood Focus instead, making all their melee attacks Impaling (see @JournalEntry[Weapons]{Impale}).</p>\n<h4>@Compendium[wfrp4e-familiars.familiar_items.vAzA74aqeX1G4ZYP]{Infernal Power}</h4>\n<p>As @Compendium[wfrp4e-familiars.familiar_items.4QIoR0q84LU4SEu9]{Magic Power}, except the bonus is +2 SLs.</p>\n<h4>@Compendium[wfrp4e-familiars.familiar_items.pMX8qOVInleCoOos]{Master’s Touch}</h4>\n<p>As the familiar Trait by the same name.</p>\n<h4>@Compendium[wfrp4e-familiars.familiar_items.Wp5jTQdPiPE1aS2D]{Master’s Voice}</h4>\n<p>As the familiar Trait by the same name.</p>\n<h4>@Compendium[wfrp4e-familiars.familiar_items.QkbSsrs4xpW6qFhX]{Dark Whisperer}</h4>\n<p>As @Compendium[wfrp4e-familiars.familiar_items.5PYimxO0qzFg8BE0]{Voice of Reason}, except the daemonologist may also elect to apply any one of the bonus effects (Critical Cast, Total Power, or Unstoppable Force) to any spell they cast at any time and gain 1 Corruption point.</p>\n<h4>@Compendium[wfrp4e-familiars.familiar_items.jDiJLENVX36FEIuK]{Blood Whisperer} (Daemons of Khorne Alternative)</h4>\n<p>Instead of @Compendium[wfrp4e-familiars.familiar_items.QkbSsrs4xpW6qFhX]{Dark Whisperer}, the daemonologist gains Blood Whisperer. Anytime the daemonologist fumbles in melee combat, they may, in addition to rolling on the @Table[oops]{Oops! Table} normally, inflict a Critical Wound on their opponent and gain 1 Corruption point.</p>\n<h3>The Perils of Daemonic Familiars</h3>\n<p>Daemonic familiars impart the same perils as non-daemonic familiars to the masters, with the following additions:</p>\n<h4>A Sure Sign of Sorcery</h4>\n<p>Daemonic familiars are clear signs of complicity with the Ruinous Powers. Normal familiars are often grounds enough for harassment by witch hunters and other opponents of Chaos, but having a daemon in one’s employ is grounds for immediate persecution and destruction.</p>\n<h4>The “Loving” Attention of Chaos</h4>\n<p>Daemonic familiars are clear signs of the attention of Chaos upon the daemonologist - attention the daemonologist often deliberately sought out.</p>\n<p>Sometimes a daemon, sent by a Ruinous Power, will offer its services to an “up-andcoming” daemonologist, becoming a daemonic familiar by its own volition. This is as clear a sign as any that the Dark God has an interest in the character’s career.</p>\n<p>Those who conjure daemonic familiars are likely to attract even more attention, drawing to themselves daemons and other agents of Chaos.</p>\n<h2>Appendix - Bestiary</h2>\n<h3>Imps</h3>\n<p>Imps are the least of the least, minor daemons that are born from loosed emotions. In their “natural” state, they are amorphous things, endlessly cycling through a variety of shapes that seem to reflect the thought or concept that birthed them. It is only when a Dark God claims an Imp that it becomes something.</p>\n<p>Daemonologists and Chaos Sorcerers conjure imps to serve as familiars.</p>\n<h4>@Compendium[wfrp4e-familiars.familiar_actors.coCWnz35loi9x0AP]{Bubo}</h4>\n<p>Imps of Nurgle are tiny versions of Nurglings, being delicate, fragile, foul, and green. They look like small withered peas but are dimpled with sphincters that issue foul yellow wetness. These creatures thrive on sickness.</p>\n<p><strong>Special:</strong> The Bubo can choose to infect a person it wounds with its Bite with Neiglish Rot instead of Festering Wounds (as per Infected). It may choose to do this its WPB times per day.</p>\n<h4>@Compendium[wfrp4e-familiars.familiar_actors.fRQVOlzjmzapeKpC]{Fearling}</h4>\n<p>Imps of Tzeentch are small balls of pink flesh, like a miniature Horror of Tzeentch. It sits and quivers, expelling blue and pink flames from its many mouths. When it moves, it pulls itself along with pseudopodia, scorching the ground wherever it goes. Fearlings inspire rebellious thoughts and acts of anarchy.</p>\n<p><strong>Special: </strong>As a free action, the Fearling can grant an ally within its Willpower yards +1 SL bonus on spell casting tests. It may choose to do this its WPB times per day.</p>\n<h4>@Compendium[wfrp4e-familiars.familiar_actors.Ry4B5VC2DcjxsvsA]{Malice}</h4>\n<p>Imps of Khorne are miniature warriors encased in black armor. They look like tiny Chaos Warriors and indeed, they have the temperament of the most vicious Khorne Champion. Malices feed on rage and hate, inspiring both in mortals.</p>\n<p><strong>Special: </strong>As a free action, The Malice can imbue Frenzy in any ally up to its Willpower yards away. It may choose to do this its WPB times per day.</p>\n<h4>@Compendium[wfrp4e-familiars.familiar_actors.1eVuzIT7tDWtUN9w]{Muse}</h4>\n<p>Imps of Slaanesh are appealing, taking the form of beautiful young men or women with perfect nubile bodies and luscious hair of scintillating colors. They are small, no taller than three feet, but despite their size, they have power over mortals, stealing their souls, and draining away the capacity for sensation. But they are also inspiring, urging their victims to new heights, always pushing further and further to attain the glory they seek.</p>\n<p><strong>Special: </strong>As a free action, the Muse may grant a +10 bonus to any skill test made by an ally up its Willpower yards away. It may choose to do this its WPB times per day.</p>","_id":"25mg0fUFUrgayzSq"}

Common components include mud, clay, dung, blood, and the vital organs of humans and animals, but these only scratch the surface. The availability of components useful in creating familiars varies widely. In large cities like Altdorf, they can often be purchased, but in other places, you must harvest many of them yourself.</p>\n<p>You must locate and obtain three important components for your homunculus, abstracted here as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Corpora</li>\n<li>Mentis</li>\n<li>Animae</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These 'components' are abstractions to represent the many dozen physical and metaphysical <em>things</em> you must obtain.</p>\n<p>The <em>corpora</em> are the components that form the exterior shape and body of the homunculus.</p>\n<p>The <em>mentis</em> are the components that will shape the intelligence and mind of the homunculus .</p>\n<p>The <em>animae</em> are the components that will bring the spark of life to the homunculus. The GM is free and encouraged to describe what each component entails.</p>\n<p>Obtaining each component requires a successful @JournalEntry[Endeavours], specifically either a @JournalEntry[Consult an Expert] to find a source for the component or a @JournalEntry[Research Lore] to source the component yourself.</p>\n<p>Thus it will take three successful Endeavors to obtain all the components for the familiar.</p>\n<p>Of course, @JournalEntry[Corruption]{Dark Deals} may be made during these Endeavors, and in fact often are by witches and the like. You may make one or more Dark Deals to automatically succeed with these Endeavors, gaining the component you need and 1 Corruption point each time.</p>\n<h3>The Cost of the Components</h3>\n<p>The cost of the components is abstracted. The expense is assumed to be one of the reasons why the wizard is out of money @JournalEntry[Endeavours]{Money to Burn}.</p>\n<p>However, a wizard’s Social Status does dictate his overall purchase power and limits the materials he can access (see the Created Familiar Material Table below). For example, a career Wizard, at level 2, has a Social Status of Silver 3. His “purchasing power” allows him to obtain materials to make familiars made of straw and cloth, detritus, wood, and both animal-like and humanoid viscera.</p>\n<h4>Using Temporary Wealth Beyond Status</h4>\n<p>It is possible a wizard wishes to construct a familiar beyond his normal purchasing power dictated by his social status. Perhaps he has recently looted a tomb and come away with handful of gold crowns worth of treasure and wishes to convert his new wealth into a hulking large homunculus made of humanoidviscera.</p>\n<p>Normally, this would require a social standing of Gold 6 which is far more than a level 2 wizard could easily afford with Silver 3 @JournalEntry[Going To Market]{Tracking Money}.</p>\n<p>In these cases, the GM can determine how much the actual cost of the materials are by using the income table on @JournalEntry[Status] as a guide. The “amount on hand” the wizard will need before beginning his Endeavors will be twice the amount indicated by the income table for the Social Status requirement of the familiar’s material components. This amount is deducted from the wizard’s cash on hand before any Endeavors (including Banking).</p>\n<p>Following the example above, the wizard (Silver 3) wants to create a large familiar from humanoid viscera (Social Status requirement Gold 6) would need to have at least 12 GC cash on hand (Gold 6 yields 6 GC income, and he needs twice that amount) before beginning his Endeavors to locate the materials.</p>\n<p>If the wizard has wealth banked but not in hand, he can perform a normal Banking Endeavor to extract the necessary cash from the bank before beginning his component gathering Endeavors.</p>\n<h3>Crafting</h3>\n<p>Once you have gathered the <em>corpora, mentis,</em> and <em>animae</em> for your familiar, you need to craft them into your homunculus. This requires a special @JournalEntry[Crafting]{Crafting Endeavor}, with the following stipulations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Before you can even begin, you need access to the appropriate @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.OD83JAlc9KhDpHK5]{Trade Tools (Magic)} and a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.ixOMVrEC1ISyYdDU]{Workshop (Magic)}. Both the Trade Tools (Magic) and the Workshop are Exotic (Trade Tools are normally Rare). Obtaining the tools and workshop should entail additional adventures or Endeavors if you cannot outright purchase them.</li>\n<li>Instead of using a Trade skill for the Endeavor, you use your Channeling skill, combined with your Lore (Magic) or Lore (Dark Magic) skill (@JournalEntry[Tests]{Combining Skills}), representing the magic ritual needed to create the familiar.</li>\n<li>The Endeavor is a Extended Combined Hard (–20) Channeling and Lore (Magic or Dark Magic) Test.</li>\n<li>The number of success levels you need to complete your homunculus is based on the form, size, and materials you wish to make your familiar from (see below). You free to spend Fortune or Resilience, or make Dark Deals when making these tests. You may need to take the Endeavor multiple times to complete the familiar.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Form</h4>\n<p>You may select either humanoid or animalistic for your familiar’s base form.</p>\n<p>Animalistic base forms require 4 Success Levels during the Crafting Endeavor(s) to complete.</p>\n<p>Humanoid base forms require 6 Success Levels during the Crafting Endeavor(s) to complete.</p>\n<p>Both base forms are Size (Small).</p>\n<p>For both forms, you can specify what species the familiar takes after (human-like, dwarflike, etc. for humanoid forms; dog-like, elephant-like, etc. for animalistic forms), but this does not mean the familiar can easily pass for that species: the homunculus is clearly artificial and wouldn’t fool anyone. You may declare that your familiar is dwarf-like, but no one will confuse it for a dwarf except under the most extreme conditions.</p>\n<p>Humanoid forms usually have prehensile hands, while animalistic forms usually do not.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3>Wait! How Does Silver become Gold?</h3>\n<p>As described in @JournalEntry[Status]{Keeping Up Appearances}, Status is ranked 0 through 5 (eg, Brass 0 through Brass 5). If you are Silver 1 and drop to Silver 0, you effectively become Brass 5.<br />These rules assume the reverse is true: if you take Silver 3, multiply by 2, you have Silver 6, which is actually Gold 1 (6–5=1).</p>\n<p>Gold tier status has no maximum. For example, if a wizard wished to create a truly monstrous familiar made of wood, it would have a Status requirement of Brass 132, which converts to Gold 122. The wizard would need 244 GC on hand to begin the component gathering Endeavors.</p>\n<p>The following table might help.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Brass to Silver to Gold Table</h4>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Brass</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Silver</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Gold</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Brass 0-4</td>\n<td>n/a</td>\n<td>n/a</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Brass 5</td>\n<td>(Silver 0)</td>\n<td>n/a</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Brass 6 </td>\n<td>Silver 1</td>\n<td>n/a</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Brass 7</td>\n<td>Silver 2</td>\n<td>n/a</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Brass 8</td>\n<td>Silver 3</td>\n<td>n/a</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Brass 9</td>\n<td>Silver 4</td>\n<td>n/a</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Brass 10</td>\n<td>Silver 5</td>\n<td>(Gold 0)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Brass 11</td>\n<td>Silver 6 </td>\n<td>Gold 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Brass 12</td>\n<td>Silver 7</td>\n<td>Gold 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Brass 13</td>\n<td>Silver 8</td>\n<td>Gold 3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Brass 14</td>\n<td>Silver 9</td>\n<td>Gold 4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Brass 15</td>\n<td>Silver 10</td>\n<td>Gold 5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Brass 16</td>\n<td>Silver 11</td>\n<td>Gold 6 </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"background-color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)\">Brass 17</span></td>\n<td>Silver 12</td>\n<td>Gold 7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Brass 18</td>\n<td>Silver 13</td>\n<td>Gold 8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Brass 19</td>\n<td>Silver 14</td>\n<td>Gold 9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Brass 20</td>\n<td>Silver 15</td>\n<td>Gold 10 </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>And so on...</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h4>Chimeras</h4>\n<p>You are free to combine forms in your familiar, up to a number of form combinations equal to your Intelligence Bonus.</p>\n<p>To determine the the required number of Success Levels to create the form, simply sum the SLs of the base forms you are combining.<br />Thus, if you wanted to create a chimera with the pig-like body, seal-like limbs, and the face of a dwarf-like thing, you’d need 14 Success Levels (4+4+6) to complete it.</p>\n<p>Success level modifiers for material or size (see below) are applied <em>after</em> calculating the chimera’s base SLs.</p>\n<h3>Deciding on the Material</h3>\n<p>Once you have decided what form you want your familiar to take, you need to determine the materials you want to make your familiar out of. You are free to select any material you want (and can obtain and afford - see above), in any combination you wish (you could make a familiar out of viscera and stone, for example).</p>\n<p>Your chosen material adds additional Success Levels to your the required number of SLs you need to complete the form.</p>\n<p>If you select multiple materials, you need only account for the most expensive material used.<br />Thus, if you desired to make a familiar out of viscera and stone, the cost and success levels would be based on the stone.</p>\n<h4>Created Familiar Size and Materials Table</h4>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Material</td>\n<td>Standing</td>\n<td>SL</td>\n<td>Notes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Straw/Cloth</td>\n<td>Brass 1</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>Flammable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Detritus</td>\n<td>Brass 3</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wood</td>\n<td>Brass 5</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>Flammable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Viscera (Animal-like)</td>\n<td>Silver 1</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Viscera (Humanoid)</td>\n<td>Silver 3</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stone (Base)</td>\n<td>Silver 5</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>Inflammable, Armor 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Metal (Base)</td>\n<td>Gold 1</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td>Inflammable, Armor 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stone (Semi-precious)</td>\n<td>Gold 3</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td>Inflammable, Armor 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Metal (Alloy or semi-precious)</td>\n<td>Gold 5</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td>Inflammable, Armor 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Metal (Precious)</td>\n<td>Gold 7</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td>Inflammable, Armor 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stone (Precious)</td>\n<td>Gold 9</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td>Inflammable, Armor 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Meta-physical</td>\n<td>Gold 11</td>\n<td>+8</td>\n<td>GM Fiat</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tiny</td>\n<td>Standing - 2</td>\n<td>-4</td>\n<td>Requires Int Bonus 3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Little</td>\n<td>Standing - 1</td>\n<td>-2</td>\n<td>Requires Int Bonus 3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Average</td>\n<td>Standing + 2</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>Requires Int Bonus 3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Large!</td>\n<td>Standing + 8</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>Requires Int Bonus 4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Enormous!!</td>\n<td>Standing + 32</td>\n<td>+16</td>\n<td>Requires Int Bonus 6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Monstrous!!!</td>\n<td>Standing + 128</td>\n<td>+64</td>\n<td>Requires Int Bonus 8</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Unusual Size</h3>\n<p>Normally, familiars are Size (Small). You are free to craft a familiar of unusual size (Tiny, Little, Average, Large, Enormous, or Monstrous), but the cost and success requirements change. Additionally, only the most intelligent wizards can craft familiars of larger statures - you must meet the Intelligence Bonus requirement as well.</p>\n<p>To determine the number of success levels you’ll need to create the familiar, add the SLs for the selected size to your base form’s SLs.</p>\n<p>To determine the actual cost of the familiar, you modify the base material cost (Standing) by the number indicated for the size. For example, if you want to make a Large (Standing +8) familiar out of a base stone like granite (cost Silver 5), the cost would be Silver 13, which converts to Gold 8 (see Brass to Silver to Gold, above). On the other hand, if you crafted a Tiny familiar from granite, it would have a base cost of Silver 3.</p>\n<p>Smaller (Tiny and Little) familiars are cheaper and easier to craft, while larger (man-size [Average], Large, Enormous, and Monstrous) familiars are ruinously expensive and timeconsuming (with ample chances for complete failure).</p>\n<p><strong>Note: </strong>A familiar takes minimum of 2 Success Levels to craft successfully and has a minimum cost of Brass 1. There are no maximums to these values.</p>\n<h3>Material Traits</h3>\n<p>Your material selection grants the familiar traits based on the material:</p>\n<p><strong>Flammable:</strong> Your familiar is particularly susceptible to fire. Your familiar cannot use its Toughness Bonus against fire damage and suffers a –2 SL penalty in Opposed Tests versus Fire.</p>\n<p><strong>Armor:</strong> Your familiar has the Armor 1 trait, or adds +1 to its Armor trait if it gains it otherwise.</p>\n<p><strong>Inflammable:</strong> While not immune to fire, it may double its Toughness Bonus against fire damage and receives a +2 SL bonus in Opposed Tests versus Fire.</p>\n<h4>A Simple Example</h4>\n<p>Alfred, a career Wizard (level 2), wants to make a familiar for himself. He decides he wants an animalist cat-like familiar. He wants to make it out of viscera.</p>\n<p>The cost of the animal viscera components is Silver 1. something he can easily afford based on his social standing of Silver 3 as a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.m6WuSnrrW7QllX63]{Wizard}.</p>\n<p>Once he has successfully gathered the components, he needs a total of 8 Success Levels to complete the crafting of the familiar (base 4 for a base-form and +4 for using viscera).</p>\n<p>The familiar is Size (Small).</p>\n<h4>A Tiny Example</h4>\n<p>Alfred changes his mind and wants a Tiny version of the cat-like familiar, because it’s cheaper and easier to make. Tiny modifies the cost standing down by 2 from Silver 3 to Silver 1. It also modifies the number Success Levels he needs to succeed down from 8 to 4.</p>\n<h4>A Larger Example</h4>\n<p>Alfred has second thoughts and decides he wants to create a chimera with the body of a cat and the head of a snake. He wants it larger, too: Average-sized. He also changes his mind about the viscera and wants to make it out of copper (a base metal).</p>\n<p>The base cost of the copper components is Gold 1. Because he wants a larger Average-sized familiar, the cost goes up to Gold 3 (Gold 1 + 2). He’ll need to scrounge up 6 GC cash on hand (because he needs twice the standing cost when he can’t normally afford it) before he can even start looking for the components.</p>\n<p>Once he has obtained the components, he will need a total of 16 Success Levels (4+4 for the animal-like chimera, +2 for size, +6 for base metal material) to craft the familiar.</p>\n<h4>A Bigger Example</h4>\n<p>Alfred just isn’t happy with the copper catsnake familiar. He decides he wants to make another chimera, but larger and out of silver! Fortunately, his Intelligence is 45, so he has the necessary smarts (Intelligence Bonus 4) to contemplate the large familiar.</p>\n<p>Silver is semi-precious metal, with a base material cost of Gold 5. Large adds +8 to the base cost of the chimera making it Gold 13. Alfred will need 26 GCs cash on hand before he can begin searching for the components.</p>\n<p>Once he has obtained the components, he will need a total 18 Success Levels to complete his Large (+4), silver (+6), cat-snake chimeric (4x2) familiar.</p>\n<h4>A Monstrous Example</h4>\n<p>Alfred falls prey to the Ruinous Powers and becomes powerful necromancer feared by the Empire. After decades of study, he decides to craft a monstrous troll-like familiar out of bone (humanoid viscera).</p>\n<p>His Intelligence Bonus after all this time is 8, so he can contemplate the monstrosity. His base form is humanoid (6 SLs). His base material is viscera (+4 SLs). His base cost for humanoid viscera is Silver 3. Because the form is Size (Monstrous), he adds +128 to the base cost, arriving at Silver 131, which is Gold 126. He’ll need 74 Success Levels to complete it and 252 GC on hand to even begin.</p>\n<h3>Oddities of Form</h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, while the wizard has control over the general form of the homunculus, most homunculi are odd and warped in some way.</p>\n<p>Roll on the @Table[familiars-oddity-of-form]{Oddity of Form Table}, to determine the familiar’s oddity.</p>\n<p>If you both succeeded every Crafting Endeavor test and achieved an <strong>Impressive Success (+3 or +4)</strong> on at least one test during the Crafting Endeavor(s), you may elect to to forego rolling on the Oddity of Form Table entirely or you may choose any oddity of form you desire – you were able to craft exactly what you wanted.</p>\n<p>Though the body shapes listed above may approximate living creatures, it is obvious to all who look on the familiar that it is formed of mud, stone, wood, flesh, or whatever components the wizard used. It is clearly not a natural creature.</p>\n<p>In the event of missing body parts, you may choose which parts are gone. In the event of extra body parts, you may define what form they take (whether an extra limb is an arm or leg, for example) and where they are attached.</p>\n<h3>The Spark of Life - Binding the Familiar</h3>\n<p>Once the homunculus is successfully crafted, you must imbue it with a spark of life and bind it to yourself. This is represented as a special @JournalEntry[Unusual Learning] to learn the @Compendium[wfrp4e-familiars.familiar_items.M1SZ5bhDS0WbM697]{Familiar Bond Talent} (the Familiar Bond is treated as a talent outside of all Careers). You do not have to find a tutor first - you already know what you need to know, you is just squaring the circle of the binding, so to speak.</p>\n<p>You must still spend <span style=\"background-color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)\">@Roll[2d10]</span> shillings per 100 XP required to learn the talent (representing the various chemicals, distillates, magical powders, samples of viscera, small animals for sacrifice, or whatever miscellaneous materials you need to fully complete the homunculus ritual) and you must still make a <strong>Combined Hard (–20) Channeling and Lore (Magic or Dark Magic)</strong> Test to succeed as per <em>Unusual Learning</em>. When the test succeeds, the homunculus leaps to life and is bound to you.</p>"}

The following sections describe the ways this is true.</p>\n<h3>A Sign of Wizardry</h3>\n<p>Possessing a familiar is a sure sign to ignorant and superstitious commoners that one is a magic-user of some sort. Drawing the attention of the small-minded brings all the usual perils: being avoided, harassed, driven away, reported to Witch Hunters, or even directly attacked as a servant of the Ruinous Powers. Luckily, most commoners are bad at identifying familiars for what they are. (This, unfortunately, can be a peril for non-magic characters who are particularly attached to some favored — but entirely mundane — animal that is mistaken for a familiar.)</p>\n<h3>Attention of Chaos</h3>\n<p>Familiars are magical creatures, and as such, they attract the attention of Daemons and other magical creatures. When creating adventures and adjudicating action in scenes, the GM should keep in mind that familiars attract such special attention in order to keep the familiar’s master on his toes.</p>\n<h3>Obsession</h3>\n<p>Because of the close relationship the master and familiar share, it is possible for the master to become utterly obsessed with his magical servant. Every time the familiar spends XP on an advancement pick or new familiar ability, its master must make an <strong>Average (+20) Fellowship </strong>Test. If he fails, he becomes gains (or adds to) the @Compendium[wfrp4e-familiars.familiar_items.BR96VqB3vMxKPIKp]{Obsession (Familiar)} psychology trait.</p>\n<h3>Death or Departure</h3>\n<p>Familiars die. So do their masters. It is also rumored that there are spells — rituals, perhaps — that can sever the relationship between a master and familiar. If either party to a familiar bonding dies, or if the relationship is severed (which can also be done by mutual agreement between master and familiar) both suffer a –10 penalty to all tests for a week, during which time the afflicted is alternately cranky, sullen, distressed, and occasionally violent without provocation. At the end of the week, the wounded party can make a <strong>Very Hard (–30) Fellowship</strong> Test. Upon success, the penalty is no more. If the test fails, however, it remains for another week, at which point another test can be attempted. The test gets one-step easier each week, though, becoming simply <strong>Hard (–20)</strong> in the second week, <strong>Difficult (–10)</strong> in the third week, and so on. If the afflicted individual still does not pass the test when it becomes <strong>Very Easy (+60)</strong>, the state of psychic discord has persisted so long that the penalty becomes <strong>permanent</strong>, and no further <strong>Fellowship</strong> Tests are allowed to shake it off.</p>\n<h3>Aethyric Link</h3>\n<p>Familiars have a special link to their masters, and because of this link, enemy spell casters can exploit the bond. As such, spell casters can use another Wizard’s familiar as a special ingredient to augment spells targeting the familiar’s master. They must touch the familiar to do so. The familiar adds a +1 SL to the casting test. When used in this way, the familiar experiences intense pain and must succeed on a <strong>Difficult (–10) Willpower</strong> Test or take 1 Wound (directly) - this can cause a Critical Hit if the familiar is reduced to 0 Wounds, and death if the familiar receives more Critical Hits than its Toughness Bonus (WFRP p173). @Condition[Unconscious] familiars cannot resist being used and automatically take 1 Wound. Naturally, sane familiars do what they can to avoid being used in this way.</p>\n<p>A Wizard cannot use his own familiar to get a bonus when he casts spells to affect himself. A Wizard’s allies could conceivably use a familiar to cast friendly spells on its master, but a Wizard who frequently allowed this would face open rebellion from his familiar in very short order.</p>","_id":"4WCJroVASJXDDfr7"}

Since those who work magic are often shunned, a wizard’s familiar is frequently the only one he can truly call friendly (and only friendly sometimes — a familiar can as easily be crotchety or sullen). Familiars come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, and can have a wide array of abilities upon which their masters can call in the service of research, defense, spell-casting, and more.</p>\n<p>There are three methods by which a wizard may obtain a familiar. The first is by creating a creature from unliving materials and imbuing it with life by magical means. Such creatures are sometimes called homunculi, though they are also known by other names, and the traditional concept of a homunculus — a small, humanlike creature — does not describe by far the wide variety of created familiars that are possible. The second method of obtaining a familiar is to bind a living creature to your company and service. Cats, birds, and rodents are typical bound familiars, but nearly any other living creature can be bound as a familiar.</p>\n<p>Finally, familiars can be summoned from the Realm of Chaos. Calling Daemon Imps — and even more powerful Daemonic creatures — to become familiars is dangerous business, and only the most depraved Dark Mages attempt to do so.</p>"}

{"name":"05. Created and Bound Familiars","permission":{"default":0,"49AXXoPz63AAzPKB":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_8d3cnnqny08","path":"Familars","color":"#65008a"}},"content":"<h2>Created and Bound Familiars</h2>\n<h3>Fumbles During Creation or Binding Endeavors</h3>\n<p>If you fumble the test during the @JournalEntry[Crafting] or @JournalEntry[Unusual Learning] Endeavors to create or bind a familiar (when crafting a homunculus, building rapport with an animal, or finally binding the familiar to you), the ritual fails completely and you must roll on the @Table[minormis]{Minor Miscast Table}, adding +10 to the roll for every failed SL on the fumble. The familiar is destroyed, killed, or otherwise lost to you and you must start the entire process again. This is a primary reason why most wizards craft small familiars or focus on suitable animals to bind: the number of Tests that must be passed to create a larger familiar or bind an unsuitable one expose the wizard to too much risk.</p>\n<h3>Cognition and Speech</h3>\n<p>All familiars gain the ability to cogitate as part of the binding ritual, immediately gaining the ability to understand a normal mortal language of the master’s choosing. The master may also choose whether or not the creature can actually speak.</p>\n<h3>Personality</h3>\n<p>Once you have either created or bound a familiar, you must determine more about its personality, and the nature of your relationship to it. The unique character of familiars and their relationships to wizards means that one can never know exactly what a given creature’s personality as a familiar will be until it’s bound or created. Likewise, it’s impossible to predict how it will feel about its new master after the process. The reason for this is obvious with created familiars, but even familiars that undergo the process of binding can see their personalities changed drastically by the experience.</p>\n<p>To determine the nature of the relationship you and your familiar share, roll on the @Table[familiars-relationship]{Relationship Table}.</p>\n<p>To determine a new familiar’s personality, roll on the @Table[familiars-personality]{Personality Table}.</p>\n<h3>Role-playing the Familiar</h3>\n<p>A wizard’s familiar is an interesting hybrid, falling somewhere between an unthinking extension of the wizard character — like an ordinary riding horse, or even a magical staff — and a fully realized character in its own right, capable of acting on its own, with its own agenda. This gives rise to the question: Who controls the familiar in play? Does the wizard speak for the familiar and control its actions absolutely, or does the GM play it as an NPC? And how do personalities like Argumentative and Inconsiderate, and relationships where master and familiar are At Odds, figure into the situation?</p>\n<p>The basic rule is that a familiar’s master controls its actions and speaks for it during the game, but is understood to do so on the overworked GM’s behalf. If, at any time, the GM feels the familiar would do something other than what the player specifies, he may overrule the player and spell out some other course of action. This applies on all levels, from the way a familiar interacts with a curious NPC to the way a familiar spends his advancement picks.</p>\n<p>Even though the GM has the final authority on what the familiar wants and intends, a familiar’s master also has concrete — if not absolute — sway over his familiar. Any time a familiar’s master becomes aware that his familiar is doing something contrary to his wishes, he may engage in an <strong>Opposed Willpower</strong> Test with his familiar in order to bully it into going his way. This may have consequences down the line (no one likes to be pushed around), and so the master may want to try to persuasion before commandment. But the <strong>Opposed Willpower</strong> Test always remains an option to keep a recalcitrant familiar in line.</p>\n<h3>Familiar Attributes, Traits, and Careers</h3>\n<p>The way a familiar’s statistics are generated varies between created and bound familiars, as described in the sections that follow. What’s common to both, however, is they make advancements according to the familiar’s career (below). Familiars gain XP at half the rate their masters do; for every 2 points a familiar’s master accumulates, the familiar earns 1. Familiars never earn XP on their own.</p>\n<p>In addition to spending XP on advancement picks from the familiar’s career, familiars can also spend XP to buy new talents and special familiar abilities.</p>\n<h3>Familiar Career</h3>\n<p>Familiars may follow careers just like any other character, though they are restricted by their forms. They are intelligent and (mostly) freewilled creatures, with desires and interests of their own.</p>\n<p>When bound, the wizard (or GM) selects a career for the familiar from the following list:</p>\n<p><strong>Initial Familiar Careers: </strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.cIBJfaY9DKJh5ZEM]{Scholar}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.djOQaw7iRfec9UEj]{Beggar}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.g12yhcU74qsRKxXX]{Servant}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.2RxWvPZCKW2ShY5a]{Hunter}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.8pk2uCvAMUAXWbcP]{Messenger}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.LaTDWvLySPKGojiW]{Huffer}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.TgcyR0ZdG6bMOK9o]{Thief}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.qaL8gLZdfOL5F5UV]{Guard}<br />A familiar’s career isn’t <em>exactly</em> like a following normal career, but represents a roughed-in estimate of familiar’s proclivities.</p>\n<p>Familiar careers don’t have Social Status or Trappings attached to them.</p>\n<h4>Substitute Skills</h4>\n<p>Not all skills listed in a career may make sense for familiars (for example, <em>Row</em> for a toad familiar). If a skill seems ridiculous or inappropriate for the familiar, substitute a skill from the following list to customize the familiar’s career more to your liking and the demands of logic:</p>\n<p><strong>Substitute Familiar Skills:</strong> @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.LGHozP5gmQ8cuDQV]{Athletics}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.exLrBrn2mjb6x2Cq]{Charm}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.pxNjTxsp1Kp0SmQe]{Cool}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.CcNJsS4jSwB6Ug1J]{Endurance}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.cYtU0ORRFCOpQLWz]{Intuition}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.XQiiwS9m2Du1IMUz]{Language (Any)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.DRO5DLF6UcfkvNSh]{Lore (Any)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.jLyoyqwmBVPjRjhM]{Melee (Brawling)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.Fs06sr7y9JKpVQmB]{Perception}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.MeXCAQ3wqJzX07X7]{Ride (Appropriate Anima)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.McTtmZu3Ac8Lh48W]{Stealth (Any)}</p>\n<h4>Inappropriate Talents</h4>\n<p>Not all talents make sense for familiars (for example, Shieldsman for a cat familiar). In these cases, there are no substitutions - the talent is just not available.</p>\n<h3>Advanced Familiar Careers</h3>\n<p>Familiars must complete their initial career before advancing, but otherwise advance like player characters. In addition to the eight careers listed above, familiars may enter the following careers after completing their initial career:</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Familiar Careers: </strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.m6WuSnrrW7QllX63]{Wizard}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.DAHJ4cu3WiGCdakE]{Investigator}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.Tt8DCpewqkmBq02v]{Watchman}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.J8ejrXE0zWMjNsZd]{Advisor}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.dWLxT0zRnDFbwTKZ]{Spy}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.pxxGfn6ze45dwg4Y]{Hedge Witch}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.Xl9yyv67BB8a8XFo]{Scout}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.b96g5MZr3rk5zYAo]{Entertainer}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.TaOvUqKMJoPeuynD]{Smuggler}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.5ITpDJoRHlIgbE0g]{Witch}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.15N8GauWXWfbYbEQ]{Pit Fighter}</p>\n<h4>Magical Careers</h4>\n<p>A familiar may only enter a magical career that matches the one followed by its master. In effect, the familiar becomes an apprentice to the master. In the case where the master has followed two magical careers (a hedge wizard becoming a licensed wizard, for example), the wizard can teach the familiar the career of his choice.</p>\n<h3>Familiar Downtime</h3>\n<p>Familiars cannot take Endeavors, but you may take Endeavors on your familiar’s behalf. For example, if you would like your familiar to engage in Unusual Learning, you must take the Endeavor out of your pool of Endeavors on the familiar’s behalf. This represents you taking the time and effort to train and assist your familiar as it grows.</p>\n<h3>Familiar Lore Traits</h3>\n<p>The familiar’s form will take after the magic Lore used to create it or bind it, reflecting in some way the Wind which sustains it. Familiars created with <em>Aqshy</em>, for example, may be reddish and warm to the touch, while familiars created with <em>Dhar</em> and Necromancy may be deathly-cold to the touch and skeletal.</p>\n<p>At the GM’s option, the familiar may have one bonus creature trait (See <em>Traits</em> in the WFRP Core compendium) for the familiar based on the source Lore.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"\\&quot;sidebar\\&quot;\">\n<h3>Created Familiar Attributes</h3>\n<p>Generate a newly created familiar’s stats by rolling according to Created Familiar Beginning Attributes Table (below).</p>\n<p>Created Familiar Attributes Table</p>\n<p><strong>Weapon Skill: </strong>[[/roll 2d10+10]]<br /><strong>Ballistic Skill:</strong> [[/roll 1d10+10]]<br /><strong>Strength: </strong>[[/roll 4d10+10]]<br /><strong>Toughness: </strong>[[/roll 4d10+10]]<br /><strong>Initiative: </strong>[[/roll 2d10+10]]<br /><strong>Agility: </strong>[[/roll 2d10+10]]<br /><strong>Dexterity:</strong> [[/roll 4d10+10]]<br /><strong>Intelligence:</strong> [[/roll 2d10+10]]<br /><strong>Willpower: </strong>[[/roll 4d10+10]]<br /><strong>Fellowship: </strong>[[/roll 1d10+10]]<br /><strong>Wounds: </strong>(see nearby)<br /><strong>Movement:</strong> [[/roll 1+1d5]]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Homunculi also begin with the Magical Sense and Frightening talents. Although certain generated statistics may sometimes seem at odds with a given created familiar’s size and shape, keep in mind that created familiars are wholly bizarre creatures for whom there is no template in the natural world. It is not so difficult to believe magic could create a hulking form susceptible to damage from an offhand swat or a small creature capable of withstanding damage that would kill a horse.</p>\n<p>Once sparked with life, created familiars get five (5) free advances to allocate to their Level 1 attributes as you see fit.</p>\n<p>However, since the familiar’s career is not a normal starting career, created familiars must acquire all the skills and talents from the career with XP as normal (with the exception of Magical Sense and Frightening bonus talents, as noted above).</p>\n<p>Created familiars do not have Fate or Resilience.</p>\n<h3>Created Familiar Size Trait</h3>\n<p>Although most created familiars are Small, the wizard may have created a familiar of a different size. After you roll on your homunculus’ attributes, add the appropriate @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.8slW8CJ2oVTxeQ6q]{Size} trait and changing the <em>Specification</em> to match the <em>Size</em> of the familiar in the <em>Details</em> tab, to automatically modify it's wounds as below.</p>\n<p><strong>Tiny:</strong> 1<br /><strong>Little:</strong> TB<br /><strong>Small:</strong> (2xTB) + WPB<br /><strong>Average:</strong> SB+(2xTB) + WPB<br /><strong>Large: </strong>(SB+(2xTB) + WPB) x2<br /><strong>Enormous:</strong> (SB+(2xTB) + WPB) x4<br /><strong>Monstrous:</strong> (SB+(2xTB) + WPB) x8</p>\n<h3>Bound Familiar Attributes</h3>\n<p>Bound familiar attributes are based on the type of beast the wizard bound (see below). The Actor is a 'Player Character' as per henchmen rules. The Bonus Skills and Talents have been included as a career which you can either temporarily select to make purchases or used to copy the skills to paste into your careers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Bound familiars lose their Bestial trait as part of the binding ritual.

As well as any animal you find in the official modules. If you make the above changes to their Int, WP and Fel, remove their Bestial trait and add their Bonus Skills and Talents as described above.</p>\n<p>After selecting the bound familiar’s career, the familiar gets five (5) free advances in its Level 1 attributes to allocate as the wizard sees fit. However, since the familiar’s career is not a normal starting career, created familiars must acquire all the skills and talents from the career with XP as normal.</p>\n<p>Bound familiars have natural traits which they gain automatically.</p>\n<h3>Bound Familiar Wounds</h3>\n<p>Bound familiars have their W calculate by their Size trait. Add the appropriate @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.8slW8CJ2oVTxeQ6q]{Size} trait and changing the <em>Specification</em> to match the <em>Size</em> of the familiar in the <em>Details</em> tab, to automatically modify it's wounds as below.:</p>\n<p><strong>Tiny:</strong> 1<br /><strong>Little:</strong> TB<br /><strong>Small:</strong> (2xTB) + WPB<br /><strong>Average:</strong> SB+(2xTB) + WPB<br /><strong>Large: </strong>(SB+(2xTB) + WPB) x2</p>\n<h3>Bound Familiar Bonus Skills and Talents</h3>\n<p>Each bound familiar has a selection of bonus skills and talents it may always consider apart of its current career.</p>\n<p>The wizard may assign his newly bound familiar one bonus talent (if any) and allocate five (5) advances to the familiar’s bonus skills (if any) as he sees fit.</p>\n<h3>Familiar Special Abilities</h3>\n<p>There are a number of different familiar special abilities and their power lies at the heart of why most wizards seek familiars. Each familiar starts with one familiar special ability, generated on the @Table[familiars-created-abilities]{Created Abilities Table} or @Table[familiars-bound-abilities]{Bound Abilities Table} as appropriate. Both familiars and their masters may also contribute XP toward buying new familiar abilities in the course of play.</p>\n<p>Familiar special abilities are learned using a modified @JournalEntry[Unusual Learning] Endeavor. The master and familiar do not need to seek out a specific trainer. Each new familiar ability costs 100 XP plus 100 XP for every special ability the familiar already has, which may be paid by the master, the familiar, or both in combination. The master or the familiar must succeed a <strong>Hard (–20) Willpower</strong> Test. The endeavor costs [[/roll 2d10]] shillings per 100 XP spent to obtain the new ability.</p>\n<h4>@Compendium[wfrp4e-familiars.familiar_items.8zjXPqCs8ZkEswto]{Aethyric Reservoir}</h4>\n<p>The familiar can absorb any spell that specifically targets it or its master, saving it for later use. To absorb the spell, the familiar must make a <strong>Hard (–20) Willpower</strong> Test. If it succeeds, it locks the spell away. The familiar may store away the spell for its Willpower Bonus in days, plus 1 day for every +2 SLs from the test. After that time, the spell withers harmlessly away (if it hasn’t gone unstable, see below). Within that period, either the master or the familiar can release that spell back into the world (as a normal cast spell action), designating a new target or targets, a new area of effect, and so forth. Treat the stored spell as having a CN of 0. Only one spell may be stored at a time; a familiar may not attempt to soak another spell if it already has one stored.</p>\n<p><strong>Stored Spell Instability</strong></p>\n<p>The GM, however, secretly rolls [[/roll 1d10]] to determine the number of days the spell can safely remain stored. If this duration expires and the stored spell remains unreleased, the magical energy becomes unstable and explodes forth uncontrollably. Once this process begins, there is nothing the wizard or familiar can do to stop it.</p>\n<p>Roll on the @Table[minormis]{Minor Miscast Table} to see what happens as the uncontrolled magic erupts.</p>\n<p>In addition, the magic burns both familiar and master from the inside out. Each takes a hit with damage equal the spell’s Casting Number minus their TB (but no armor helps). If the familiar suffers a Critical Hit with a negative Wounds value greater than its TB, it explodes.</p>\n<h4>@Compendium[wfrp4e-familiars.familiar_items.roOLZtvJXAehjtAF]{Depth of Resolve}</h4>\n<p>The familiar has an unusual depth of resolve.<br />The familiar has 1 Resolve Point that either the familiar or its master can use each day.</p>\n<h4>@Compendium[wfrp4e-familiars.familiar_items.wq4IVVR3Gebj8vhM]{Link of Psyche}</h4>\n<p>The familiar and master can communicate complex thoughts and emotions to each other instantly, without speech, and over any distance. This ability increases the ability of each to cogitate and withstand mental stresses, raising the Intelligence and Will Power of both by +10 for as long as both are conscious and cooperative.</p>\n<h4>@Compendium[wfrp4e-familiars.familiar_items.a9c3hZXI6D16Gur4]{Lucky Charm}</h4>\n<p>The familiar is somehow a magnet for good luck. The familiar has 1 Fortune Point that either the familiar or its master can use each day.</p>\n<h4>@Compendium[wfrp4e-familiars.familiar_items.NClFduYQ6vnOFygk]{Magic Focus}</h4>\n<p>The master can use the familiar’s magical nature to amplify the effects of his spell-casting much as a lens focuses light. When a spell is cast in this way, one of its quantitative effects — range, area of effect, duration, and so on — is doubled. The downside of using this ability to cast a given spell is that it always causes an effect from the @Table[minormis]{Minor Miscast Table}.</p>\n<h4>@Compendium[wfrp4e-familiars.familiar_items.4QIoR0q84LU4SEu9]{Magic Power}</h4>\n<p>As long as the familiar lives and remains his familiar, the Wizard gains a bonus of +1 SL to any spell casting or Channeling test.</p>\n<h4>@Compendium[wfrp4e-familiars.familiar_items.pMX8qOVInleCoOos]{Master’s Touch}</h4>\n<p>The familiar acts as an extension of its master’s touch, sight, and location for the purposes of casting Touch spells, casting spells at targets the caster must be able to see, and casting spells that affect the caster’s location.</p>\n<h4>@Compendium[wfrp4e-familiars.familiar_items.Wp5jTQdPiPE1aS2D]{Master’s Voice}</h4>\n<p>The master is capable of projecting his voice through his familiar. This has two effects. First, the master can communicate to anyone who is within earshot of the familiar. Second, if the familiar is within the master’s Will Power in yards of the master, the master can project his own voice through the familiar to cast spells, which allows him to cast even if he is prevented from speaking by a gag, a magic effect, or any other force (as long as it does not also affect the familiar’s ability to speak).</p>\n<h4>@Compendium[wfrp4e-familiars.familiar_items.5PYimxO0qzFg8BE0]{Voice of Reason}</h4>\n<p>The familiar dampens chaotic forces. When its master @JournalEntry[Magic Rules]{Critically Casts or Miscasts} a spell , the master may elect to re-roll the dice in order to avoid rolling on the @Table[minormis]{Minor Miscast Table}. Of course, if the first roll is a success in casting, the master may wish to keep it to be guaranteed of success. It’s up to him. If the master elects to re-roll, he must abide by the second result, whatever it is. This ability has no effect for the master if the master has the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.BYChSVfMG004eflQ]{Instinctive Diction} talent, but will work for the familiar if it has the ability to cast spells as well.</p>","_id":"FexPzAjD2sp1EBr2"}

The first is to search out a suitable creature, one whose form, fitness, and temperament are <em>just so</em>. You must purchase or capture this creature. Next, you must spend time with the creature, both making it accustomed to you and slowly imbuing it with magic. Finally, you must make a series of tests to see if you have been successful. Like creating a homunculus, this is modeled in-game via Endeavors, though the process could be spun out into a series of adventures.</p>\n<p>The search step is represented by a successful @JournalEntry[Consult an Expert] and/or @JournalEntry[Research Lore] Endeavors. If you decide not to purchase the animal, but want to capture it, the capture step is represented by one or more Crafting Endeavors, wherein you magically attract or track down the familiar in the wild. The “getting to know you” step, likewise, representing by one or more @JournalEntry[Crafting] Endeavors. And the final binding step is represented by a successful @JournalEntry[Unusual Learning] Endeavor.</p>\n<h3>The Search Endeavor</h3>\n<p>First, you need to find a suitable animal to become your familiar. This search takes time and is modeled with a @JournalEntry[Consult an Expert] Endeavor to find a person who has a suitable animal to trade or rumor of where you might find and capture the creature you desire yourself.</p>\n<p>You must pass a <strong>Challenging (+0) Gossip</strong> Test to locate a knowledgeable expert. The test is modified by the rarity of the species of familiar you want to find (see the table below).</p>\n<p>Or, you may perform a @JournalEntry[Research Lore] Endeavor to determine how and where best to find the creature yourself, making an <strong>Average (+20) Lore (appropriate)</strong> Test or a <strong>Difficult (–10) Intelligence</strong> Test to succeed. The test is modified by the rarity of the species of familiar you want to find (see the table below).</p>\n<p>The GM may rule that some animals cannot be bought. You must track them down in the wild or magically attract them.</p>\n<h3>Suitability</h3>\n<p>Not all animals are suitable for all wizards.</p>\n<p>This doesn’t stop a wizard from trying to bind a less-than-suitable animal, but it makes it harder. If you do not have the Arcane Lore talent listed in the Suitable column of the Typical Familiar Animals Table (see below), you suffer an <strong>automatic –2 SL all Tests</strong> to capture and bind the creature.</p>\n<h3>Purchase the Critter <em>(Consult an Expert)</em></h3>\n<p>If you pass @JournalEntry[Consult an Expert] test with the intent to find a seller, you find a person willing to trade the animal to you. You must negotiate with the person to obtain the animal. This usually involves a combination of payment based on the animal size and rarity and/or one or more @JournalEntry[Do Me a Favor!]{favours}.</p>\n<p>After trading for the animal, you can skip to the “Becoming Besties” step.</p>\n<p>Finding the Critter Yourself (@JournalEntry[Consult an Expert] or @JournalEntry[Research Lore]) To track down and capture the critter, you need to make a modified @JournalEntry[Crafting] Endeavor, which represents building the necessary equipment, reading the correct omens and portents from the sky and in the bottom of tea cups, and either magically attracting the animal want to you or physically tracking down it down.</p>\n<p>If you wish to magically attract the creature to you, you must generate 6 Success Levels on an <strong>Extended Combined Challenging (+0) Lore (Magic or Dark Magic) and Channeling</strong> Test.</p>\n<p>The test is modified by the rarity modifier of the species you wish to attract. When you have achieved 6 SLs, the creature arrives and you may capture it and move to the next step, Becoming Besties. You may need to execute this Endeavor multiple times.</p>\n<p>If you wish to physically track down the creature, you must generate 6 Success Levels on an <strong>Extended Combined Challenging (+0) Channeling and Track</strong> Test or an <strong>Extended Combined Hard (–20) Channeling and Perception</strong> Test. The test is modified by the rarity modifier of the species you wish to capture. When you have achieved 6 SLs, you find the beast and you may capture it and move to the next step, Becoming Besties.</p>\n<p>You may use the Success Levels generated from tthe Search Endeavor above to help with the first test you make when trying to attract or find the creature. These represent the <em>quality of the lead</em>. For every +2 Success Levels from the Search Endeavor, you can add +1 SL to your first test to magically attract or track down the animal.</p>\n<p>Unsuitable animals are harder to attract or capture. If the animal is not suitable to your Lore, you receive an automatic –2 SL penalty on all tests to attract or locate the animal.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is usually not possible to locate a <em>trained</em> animal in the wild, such as a trained warhorse or dancing bear. If you want a trained animal, you must find a person to trade it to you - or perhaps steal one from its owner. The GM should be wary of players who try to use <em>hunting for a familiar</em> to scoot around the cost of normally very expensive animals.</p>\n<h3>Becoming Besties – Building Rapport</h3>\n<p>Once you have successfully located the creature, you must spend time in its company, both making it accustomed to your presence and using magic to create the aethyric bond between you. You must keep the familiar with you constantly (at least 20 hours a day) during this period until you succeed at building rapport. You must properly care for the animal during this period otherwise the test automatically fails.</p>\n<p>This period is represented as a special Crafting Endeavor. You need a number of SLs equal to the W score of the familiar to succeed. You must make an <strong>Extended Combined Challenging (+0) Channeling and Charm</strong> Animal Test, or an <strong>Extended Combined Challenging (+0) Channeling and Animal Training</strong> Test. If the animal is not suitable for your Arcane Lore, you automatically receive –2 SLs on each test.</p>\n<p>Once you have achieved the necessary Success Levels (it may require multiple Endeavors), you may complete the ritual in the final step.</p>\n<table style=\"width:99.0712%;height:321px\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td
