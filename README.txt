Note: I intended this as add on to work as an expansion for the Official Core and Enemy in Shadows WFRP4e Modules by Moo Man and my other module Law's Pet Shoppe.
It will work without but some of the animals icons will be missing.


This module is based on:
Knut Knetmassen's
Incomplete Guide
of the Methods & Means for
Creating & Binding
Familiars
Fourth Edition
Adaptation by claycle, Version 2.1

Why do you need Familiars?
This expands the use of henchmen to allow Magic Users of all kinds to create familiars.

• Adds rules for Creating Homunculus familiars.
• Adds 17 x Bound animal Familiar Actors and rules for creating others.
• Adds 4 x Daemonic Familiars Actors and rules for creating others. 
• Adds 6 tables to create random Bound, Created and Daemonic Familiar Abilities, familiar oddities of form, familiar personalities and the nature of the familiar relationship.
• Adds 1 new Disease.
• Adds 1 new Talent.
• Adds 18 new Traits.
• Adds 2 new Spells.
• Adds 1 new Psychology.
• Adds Trappings (price lists) for each type.


One day perhaps a henchman generator like the character generator will enable better integration with this module but I lack the coding skills unfortunately.
Finally any suggestions or improvements to module I would love to hear.

A final big thanks to claycle and MooMan without which this would not exist.

thanks
